                    <p>
                        <span class="span1">Hello from Christchurch, New Zealand!</span> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website is a bit project in itself as I learn more Web Development. It is also to start gaining a bit of a presence and showcase my skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I currently work in retail at the Christchurch Airport while studying for a L5 Diploma in Web Development at Ara.

                    <p>
                        So far I have done a full website for one of the courses and have also played around with a couple of full websites at home. One being a fansite for 
                        the tv series <span class="span2">The Magicians</span>, the other being a recreation of the gaming website <span class="span2">VG24/7</span>.
