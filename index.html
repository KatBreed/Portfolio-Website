                    <p>
                        This website is a bit of project in itself as I learn more Web Development. It is also to start gaining a bit of a presence and showcase my skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently working in retail at the Christchurch Airport while studying for a L5 Diploma in Web Development at Ara.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far I have done a full website for one of the courses and have also played around with a couple of full websites at home. One being a fansite for 
                        the tv series <span class="span2">The Magicians</span>, the other being a recreation of the gaming website <span class="span2">VG24/7</span>. Of course I 
                        also play around with small indepenant or component things to experiment and learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently my knowledge includes HTML5, CSS, I have learnt Python for the diploma and am just starting to branch that out to include Javascript. As evidenced 
                        by this website. I have also incorporated Git with Fork.

                            For the Web Development course, which covered HTML and CSS and a little bit of JQuery, we had to create a full website for a fictional client wanting to create 
                            a presence for their bookshop. Each of us were also given a different author and a book of theirs to focus on for an author page. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This included repsonive design for all pages for mobile, tablet and dekstop sizes. Another requirement was a hamburger menu for mobile size and the use of 
                            only one CSS file.
                        </p>

                            I got into watching the tv series The Magicians and so ended up having a go at a fansite. The design of which was made on the fly. I wanted to take what 
                            I had learnt and apply it.

                            With a break in classes over Christmas and New Year's I got my hands back on Web Development and decided to make a mockup of the real website VG24/7 as full as I can, and branch 
                            out into Javascript. It's a slightly different experience building something that is already desgined.

                    <p>
                        I grew up a child of the 80's in Morrinsville, New Zealand. I was always running around until I 
                        discovered the likes of Sonic and Mario. I have memories of Atari, 20c arcades at the fish 'n' chips shop 
                        and computers becoming a thing with Windows '95, DOS, and big floppy disks. I then moved and lived in 
                        Whangarei, New Zealand for about 12 years before moving here to Christchurch in 2019.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I also grew up around horses as my Dad was a Harness Racing Trainer with pacers and 
                        the odd trotter. But I have always been bit of a pop culture, gaming, computer, geek.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I still game from time to time depending on how busy I am. I'm currently enjoying some Baldur's Gate 3 and Monster Hunter Rise. I also enjoy going for walks or 
                        extended walks. During the pandemic I got into running which still comes and goes in phases depending on how busy I am. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I used to be into a bit of filming and video editing for youtube and purchased a Panasonic G7 camera, however that is now primarily used for photography 
                        from time to time.I have a bit of a hearing loss for which I wear hearing aids.
